# GetWeather

## Late submission for a skipped project

### As of now, this app does the most basic of API calls, and simply displays the results in an unstyled manner to the right of the search section
### Not sure why the weather description is coming back undefined.
### Not proud of this submission, but at least I'm accessing the API. I know I need to convert the temp from Kelvin to F/C
